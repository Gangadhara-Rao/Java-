String:
Generally, String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. The java.lang.String class is used
to create a string object.

There are two ways to create String object:
1) String Literal
Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example:

String s="welcome";  

2) By new keyword

String s=new String("Welcome");

String Concatenation in Java
In Java, String concatenation forms a new String that is the combination of multiple strings. There are two ways to concatenate strings in Java:

1.By + (String concatenation) operator
2.By concat() method
1) String Concatenation by + (String concatenation) operator
Java String concatenation operator (+) is used to add strings.

2) String Concatenation by concat() method
The String concat() method concatenates the specified string to the end of current string.

Type Casting in Java
In Java, type casting is a method or process that converts a data type into another data type in both ways manually and automatically.

Types of Type Casting
There are two types of type casting:

1.Widening Type Casting
Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting. It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down.
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double  

2.Narrowing Type Casting
Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting. It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up. 
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
